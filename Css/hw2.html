            In his twilight years, Patel was honoured by members of Parliament. He was awarded honorary doctorates of
            law by Nagpur University, the University of Allahabad and Banaras Hindu University in November 1948,
            subsequently receiving honorary doctorates from Osmania University in February 1949 and from Punjab
            University in March 1949.[110][111] Previously, Patel had been featured on the cover page of the January
            1947 issue of Time magazine.[112]

            On 29 March 1949 authorities lost radio contact with a Royal Indian Air Force de Havilland Dove carrying
            Patel, his daughter Maniben, and the Maharaja of Patiala from Delhi to Jaipur.[113] The pilot had been
            ordered to fly at a low altitude due to turbulence.[114] During the flight, loss of power in an engine
            caused the pilot to make an emergency landing in a desert area in Rajasthan.[114] Owing to the aircraft's
            flying at a low altitude, the pilot was unable to send a distress call with the aircraft's VHF radio, nor
            could he use his HF equipment as the crew lacked a trained signaller.[114] With all passengers safe, Patel
            and others tracked down a nearby village and local officials. A subsequent RIAF court of inquiry headed by
            Group Captain (later Air Chief Marshal and Chief of the Air Staff) Pratap Chandra Lal concluded the forced
            landing had been caused by fuel starvation.[113][114] When Patel returned to Delhi, thousands of Congressmen
            gave him a resounding welcome. In Parliament, MPs gave a long standing ovation to Patel, stopping
            proceedings for half an hour.[115]

            Nehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth.[17] The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War
            intensified his feelings. Of the latter he wrote, "[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm.
            ...Nationalistic ideas filled my mind. ... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom
            of Europe."[14] Later, in 1905, when he had begun his institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in
            England where he was nicknamed "Joe",[18] G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes
            for academic merit, influenced him greatly.[19] He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote:
            "Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind,
            India and Italy got strangely mixed together."[14]

            In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas Gandhi was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her
            first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an arranged marriage,
            according to the custom of the region at that time.[30] In the process, he lost a year at school but was
            later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.[31] Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his
            brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, "As we didn't
            know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with
            relatives." As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents'
            house, and away from her husband.[32]

            Lal Bahadur Shastri was born in 1904 in Mughalsarai ( Uttar Pradesh ) in a Kayastha family to Munshi Sharda
            Prasad Srivastava. [2] His father was a teacher in a primary school, so everyone called him Munshiji. Later
            he took up the job of a clerk in the Revenue Department. Lal Bahadur's mother's name was Ramdulari. Being
            the youngest in the family, Lal Bahadur was fondly called Nanhe by his family members. Unfortunately, when
            Nanhe was eighteen months old, his father passed away. His mother Ramdulari went to her father Hazarilal's
            house in Mirzapur . After some time, his maternal grandfather also passed away. His maternal uncle Raghunath
            Prasad helped his mother a lot in raising Nanhe without a father . While living at his maternal
            grandparents' house, he received his primary education. His further education took place at Harishchandra
            High School and Kashi Vidyapeeth . After receiving the title of Shastri from Kashi Vidyapeeth, he removed
            the caste word 'Srivastava', which he had been using since birth, forever and added 'Shastri' to his name.
            After this, the word Shastri became synonymous with Lal Bahadur's name.In 1928 , he married Lalita, daughter
            of Ganesh Prasad , a resident of Mirzapur . Lalita and Shastriji had six children, two daughters- Kusum and
            Suman and four sons- Harikrishna, Anil, Sunil and Ashok. Out of their four sons, two- Anil Shastri and Sunil
            Shastri are still alive by the grace of God, the remaining two have passed away. Anil Shastri is a senior
            leader of the Congress Party while Sunil Shastri is a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party .

            Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle
            against the British.[136] Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his
            emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The
            fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him.[137] Some scholars think
            that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought.[138] As historian
            Leonard Gordon explains "Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set him
            apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian
            landscape."[139]Bose first expressed his preference for "a synthesis of what modern Europe calls socialism
            and fascism" in a 1930 speech in Calcutta.[140] Bose later criticized Nehru's 1933 statement that there is
            "no middle road" between communism and fascism, describing it as "fundamentally wrong". Bose believed
            communism would not gain ground in India due to its rejection of nationalism and religion and suggested a
            "synthesis between communism and fascism" could take hold instead.[141] In 1944, Bose similarly stated, "Our
            philosophy should be a synthesis between National Socialism and communism."[142]

            After joining the Indian National Congress and taking part in political agitation in Punjab, Lala Lajpat Rai
            Wadwal was deported to Mandalay, but there was insufficient evidence to hold him for subversion. Lajpat
            Rai's supporters attempted to secure his election to the presidency of the party session at Surat in
            December 1907, but he did not succeed.[10]Graduates of the National College, which he founded inside the
            Bradlaugh Hall at Lahore as an alternative to British-style institutions, included Bhagat Singh.[11] He was
            elected President of the Indian National Congress in the Calcutta Special Session of 1920.[12] In 1921, he
            founded Servants of the People Society, a non-profit welfare organisation, in Lahore, which shifted its base
            to Delhi after partition, and has branches in many parts of India.[13] According to him, Hindu society needs
            to fight its own battle with caste system, position of women and untouchability.[14] Vedas were an important
            part of Hindu religion and approved everyone should be allowed to read them and recite the mantras. He
            believed that everyone should be allowed to read and learn from the Vedas.[15]

            Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day.[33] Dressed in
            western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying
            Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their
            servant. At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the three boarded
            the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah
            railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore.[33] At Lucknow, Rajguru left
            separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to
            Lahore a few days later.[34][33]

            A women's unit of the Indian National Army was named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. In 1957 two postage stamps
            were issued to commemorate the centenary of the rebellion. Indian representations in novels, poetry, and
            film tend towards an uncomplicated valorization of Rani Lakshmibai as an individual solely devoted to the
            cause of Indian independence.[48]The Rani of Jhansi Regiment was a unit of the Indian National Army (INA),
            which was formed in 1942 by Indian nationalists in Southeast Asia during World War II. The regiment was
            named in honor of Rani Lakshmibai, the warrior queen of Jhansi who fought against British colonial rule in
            India in 1857.The Rani of Jhansi Regiment was the first all-women regiment in the history of the Indian
            Army. It was composed of Indian women who were recruited from Southeast Asia, mostly from the Indian
            diaspora in Singapore and Malaya. The women were trained in military tactics, physical fitness, and
            marksmanship, and were deployed in Burma and other parts of Southeast Asia to fight against the British.The
            regiment was led by Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan, who was a doctor and a member of the Indian National Army.
            Under her leadership, the regiment fought bravely against the British forces and played a significant role
            in the Indian independence movement.[49]The Rani of Jhansi Regiment remains an important symbol of women's
            participation in the struggle for Indian independence, and its legacy has inspired generations of women in
            India and beyond.The Indian Coast Guard ship ICGS Lakshmi Bai has been named after her.

            Tilak joined the Indian National Congress in 1890.[14] He opposed its moderate attitude, especially towards
            the fight for self-government. He was one of the most-eminent radicals at the time.[15] In fact, it was the
            Swadeshi movement of 1905–1907 that resulted in the split within the Indian National Congress into the
            Moderates and the Extremists.[11 During late 1896, a bubonic plague spread from Bombay to Pune, and by
            January 1897, it reached epidemic proportions. The British Indian Army was brought in to deal with the
            emergency and strict measures were employed to curb the plague, including the allowance of forced entry into
            private houses, the examination of the house's occupants, evacuation to hospitals and quarantine camps,
            removing and destroying personal possessions, and preventing patients from entering or leaving the city. By
            the end of May, the epidemic was under control. The measures used to curb the pandemic caused widespread
            resentment among the Indian public. Tilak took up this issue by publishing inflammatory articles in his
            paper Kesari (Kesari was written in Marathi, and "Maratha" was written in English), quoting the Hindu
            scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, to say that no blame could be attached to anyone who killed an oppressor
            without any thought of reward. Following this, on 22 June 1897, Commissioner Rand and another British
            officer, Lt.

            Mangal Pandey, a young revolutionary born on July 19, 1827, in Nagwa, Uttar Pradesh, etched his name into
            history as an emblem of love, passion, and sacrifice for the nation. Executed by the British at an early
            age, his unwavering devotion to the cause of India's independence earned him the status of a national hero,
            and his audacious act of defiance became the spark that ignited the Indian Rebellion of 1857, famously known
            as the Sepoy Mutiny.Joining the Bengal Army: A Fateful Twist of Fate In 1849 at the tender age of 22, Mangal
            Pandey enlisted in the Bengal Army, finding himself initially in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI)
            regiment before being transferred to the 5th BNI. Little did he know that his destiny was about to
            intertwine with the course of Indian history.
